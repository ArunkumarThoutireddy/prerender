# RoutingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. We used this server only to get our application running properly with routes

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Application Server

Run `node server` to run another [server](http://localhost:3002/) at port 3002. This server has `prerender-node` set up and acts as a application server, takes in static resources from `dist/` folder and servers to the client.
